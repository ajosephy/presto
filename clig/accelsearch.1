.\" cligPart OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -lobin
The first Fourier frequency in the data file,
.br
1 Int value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -numharm
The number of harmonics to sum (power-of-two),
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 16.
.br
Default: `8'
.IP -zmax
The max (+ and -) Fourier freq deriv to search,
.br
1 Int value between 0 and 1200.
.br
Default: `200'
.IP -sigma
Cutoff sigma for choosing candidates,
.br
1 Float value between 1.0 and 30.0.
.br
Default: `2.0'
.IP -rlo
The lowest Fourier frequency to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -rhi
The highest Fourier frequency to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -flo
The lowest frequency (Hz) (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.br
Default: `1.0'
.IP -fhi
The highest frequency (Hz) (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.br
Default: `10000.0'
.IP -photon
Data is poissonian so use freq 0 as power normalization.
.IP -median
Use old-style block-median power normalization (current default).
.IP -locpow
Use new-style double-tophat local-power normalization.
.IP -zaplist
A file of freqs+widths to zap from the FFT (only if the input file is a *.[s]dat file),
.br
1 String value
.IP -baryv
The radial velocity component (v/c) towards the target during the obs,
.br
1 Double value between -0.1 and 0.1.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -harmpolish
Constrain harmonics to be harmonically related during polishing.
.IP infile
Input file name of the floating point .fft or .[s]dat file.  A '.inf' file of the same name must also exist.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
